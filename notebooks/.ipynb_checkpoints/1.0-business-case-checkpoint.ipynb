    "## Implementing a Human Activity Recognition System Using Smartphone Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Smartphones, with their embedded sensors, offer vast opportunities for health and wellness applications. A notable application is Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which classifies activities of daily living (ADL) using smartphone sensor data. This capability has significant potential in fields such as healthcare, sports, elder care, and personal fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HAR dataset was created to support research in this area. It includes recordings from 30 participants aged 19 to 48, performing six different activities while wearing a waist-mounted smartphone. These activities are walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying down. Data was collected at a rate of 50Hz using the smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer and gyroscope. This dataset has been processed and labeled, providing a rich resource for developing and testing HAR systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "Despite advanced sensors in modern smartphones, effectively utilizing this data for real-time human activity recognition remains challenging. Current methods face several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Noise in Sensor Data**: Raw sensor data is often noisy, complicating accurate activity classification without extensive preprocessing.\n",
    "2. **Complex Feature Extraction**: Extracting meaningful features from time-series sensor data requires sophisticated techniques and substantial computational resources.\n",
    "3. **Limited Generalizability**: Models trained on specific datasets may not generalize well to new users or different contexts, limiting practical applicability.\n",
    "4. **Real-Time Processing Constraints**: Real-time activity recognition demands efficient algorithms that can operate on the limited processing power of smartphones without excessive battery consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient HAR system that can accurately classify daily activities in real-time using smartphone sensor data. Specific objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing and Noise Reduction**: Implement advanced filtering techniques to preprocess sensor data, minimizing noise to ensure higher accuracy.\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction and Selection**: Develop efficient methods to extract relevant features from both time and frequency domains, reducing dimensionality while retaining critical information.\n",
    "3. **Model Development and Training**: Use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), to build a model capable of accurately recognizing the six predefined activities.\n",
    "4. **Model Validation and Testing**: Validate the model with a separate test dataset to ensure accuracy and robustness, assessing its generalizability to different participants and environments.\n",
    "5. **Real-Time Implementation**: Optimize the model for real-time execution on smartphones, ensuring efficient operation without excessive battery consumption.\n",
    "6. **User Interface Development**: Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the HAR system and receive real-time feedback on their activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "The successful implementation of this project will offer several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Health Monitoring**: Provide users with accurate insights into their daily activity patterns, promoting healthier lifestyles and enabling early detection of potential health issues.\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Elder Care**: Assist caregivers in monitoring elderly individuals' activities, ensuring their safety and well-being.\n",
    "3. **Personalized Fitness Tracking**: Offer fitness enthusiasts detailed and accurate activity tracking, helping them optimize workouts and achieve fitness goals.\n",
    "4. **Contribution to Research**: Advance the field of HAR by providing a robust system that can serve as a benchmark for future research and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a Human Activity Recognition system using smartphone data presents a significant opportunity to leverage existing technology for improving health and wellness. By addressing challenges such as noise reduction, feature extraction, and real-time processing, this project aims to deliver a practical and efficient solution with benefits across various domains. This initiative has the potential to enhance daily living and contribute meaningfully to ongoing research.\n",

    "## Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "Since I am dealing with a real life problem, I must implement a workflow to keep everything simple and having a clear goal to approach and reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, in my particular case the Machine Learning Workflow will have 7 sections that will be separated in different notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Question or problem definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Acquire training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Supply or submit the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to say that having a clear mindset through the entire notebook may implied combining multiple workflow stages, perform a stage earlier than indicated or perfom a stage multiple times in our workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would not change the main goal of the project or the approach we are trying to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow goals\n",
    "As a data scientist I will use every tool available to provide a solution for seven major goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classifying:** I may want to classify or categorize our samples. I may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlating:** The problem need to be solved based on available features within the training dataset, so it is importan to ask: Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a correlation among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Converting:** Depending on the choice of model algorithm I may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complementing:** Data preparation may also require me to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correcting:** I may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors (Outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating:** I could create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features if I need to, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion and completeness goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Charting:** Select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solutions goals.\n",
